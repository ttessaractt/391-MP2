1.  issue:
    - draw_vert_line() only changing a few 'random' pixles to random colors
    fix:
    - the logic was still for creating pixels horizontally, not vertically

2.  issue:
    - in draw_vert_line()
    - when going back and forth black lines & blue bar on top get erased, 
    some grey sticks around on outer border
    fix:
    - in my for loop i started i at show_y, it should be at 0
    - the for loop also had i < SHOW_X_WIDTH, it should be i < SHOW_Y_DIM

3.  issue:
    - split screen happening at wrong location
    fix:
    - had wrong # of bits in the line compare register

4.  issue:
    - making image buffer from string wasn't working at all 
    fix:
    - to get the individual pixel value i was using (lol & b) to set the color,
    but I needed to be using (lol& (1 << b)) to actually check the bit, a stupid logic error

5.  issue:
    - my letters are backwards when displaying string
    fix:
    - i was checing the LSB but my location was for the MSB, changed my bit checking to be MSB
6.  issue:
    - my text on screen does not update for fruit or time, only level changes (when level changes)
    fix:
    - fruit was because I wasn't actually getting the # of fruit, fixed by adding a get_num_fruit() function to maze.c
    - time was not updating on screen since i never set the initial value of the variable tracking seconds
7.  issue:
    - something in my background buffer causes the new background to be blurred
    fix:
    - had to move draw_full_block out of if (dir != DIR_STOP)
8.  issue:
    - my player masking works but the player is just black
    fix:
    - i removed blk in my background_buffer function and then copied that for my draw_player function,
    i added blk back in everywhere except for the for loop, once that was addded back in it works
