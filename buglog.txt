1.  issue:
    - draw_vert_line() only changing a few 'random' pixles to random colors
    fix:
    - the logic was still for creating pixels horizontally, not vertically
2/21 
2.  issue:
    - in draw_vert_line()
    - when going back and forth black lines & blue bar on top get erased, 
    some grey sticks around on outer border
    fix:
    - in my for loop i started i at show_y, it should be at 0
    - the for loop also had i < SHOW_X_WIDTH, it should be i < SHOW_Y_DIM

3.  issue:
    - split screen happening at wrong location
    fix:
    - had wrong # of bits in the line compare register
2/24 
4.  issue:
    - making image buffer from string wasn't working at all 
    fix:
    - to get the individual pixel value i was using (lol & b) to set the color,
    but I needed to be using (lol& (1 << b)) to actually check the bit, a stupid logic error
2/25
5.  issue:
    - my letters are backwards when displaying string
    fix:
    - i was checing the LSB but my location was for the MSB, changed my bit checking to be MSB
6.  issue:
    - my text on screen does not update for fruit or time, only level changes (when level changes)
    fix:
    - fruit was because I wasn't actually getting the # of fruit, fixed by adding a get_num_fruit() function to maze.c
    - time was not updating on screen since i never set the initial value of the variable tracking seconds
7.  issue:
    - something in my background buffer causes the new background to be blurred
    fix:
    - had to move draw_full_block out of if (dir != DIR_STOP)
8.  issue:
    - my player masking works but the player is just black
    fix:
    - i removed blk in my background_buffer function and then copied that for my draw_player function,
    i added blk back in everywhere except for the for loop, once that was addded back in it works

CP2:
1. issue:
    - trying to change wall color changes wrong palette, not sure how to access correct palette
    fix:
    - there are constants given in blocks.h (WALL_FILL_COLOR) that can direct my set_palette function to the correct palette
2. issue:
    - i decided to change my string to font so it wasn't hardcoded for the status bar and it no longer works
    fix:
    - accidently passing in my status bar X_DIM not WIDTH (so it was 4x larger than it should be)
3. issue:
    - no text appears on screen when fruit eaten
    fix:
    - i wasn't actually drawing the text to the screen, i was using my display on status bar function
4. issue:
    - simply displaying text (not on status bar) does not work, it is all garbled
    fix:
    - I was trying to use my other string to text but the locations to be drawn to are different so I had to make a new function
    - my buffers were also the wrong size, set to status bar sizes on accident
5. issue:
    - my floating text draws black into the build buffer where it has been
    fix:
    - I wasn't getting my background buffers correctly
6. issue:
    - floating text is slightly off, looks to be 1 pixel, maybe 2
    fix:
    - i had an offset in my text to string (fruit) that was no longer needed
7. issue:
    - floating text not centered
    fix:
    - had to change my centering location formula since its not in mode X
8. issue:
    - wrong text prints for fruit
    fix:
    - had to subtract 1 from my the fruit #
