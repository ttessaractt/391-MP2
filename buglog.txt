1. 2/20 
    issue:
    - draw_vert_line() only changing a few 'random' pixles to random colors
    fix:
    - the logic was still for creating pixels horizontally, not vertically
2. 2/21 
    issue:
    - in draw_vert_line()
    - when going back and forth black lines & blue bar on top get erased, 
    some grey sticks around on outer border
    fix:
    - in my for loop i started i at show_y, it should be at 0
    - the for loop also had i < SHOW_X_WIDTH, it should be i < SHOW_Y_DIM
3. 2/21 
    issue:
    - split screen happening at wrong location
    fix:
    - had wrong # of bits in the line compare register
4. 2/24 
    issue:
    - making image buffer from string wasn't working at all 
    fix:
    - to get the individual pixel value i was using (lol & b) to set the color,
    but I needed to be using (lol& (1 << b)) to actually check the bit, a stupid logic error
