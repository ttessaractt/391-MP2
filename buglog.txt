buglog

1. 2/20 - draw_vert_line() not working, need to understand draw_horiz_line
    - code currently takes what is on the opposite side of screen and using that 
    - makes some garbage pixels (some random colors) on the bottom 
    - i thought i figured out how it works but i guess not
    - when scrolling -> right and then back left the wall is like a chunk over from where it should be
    2/21 - i have figured out my code is only changing the pixels that are garbage and the mirror part happens when my vert is commented
    - significant progress has been made! still has some bugs (a few cunks are wrong) but it mostly works
    - i never actually changes the way i was copying into build buffer to vertical, it was still horizontal
2. 2/21 - when going back and forth black lines & blue bar on top get erased, some grey sticks around on outer border
    - does not work on bottom, gets quite messed up when scrolling multiple times
    - draws a little in the bottom right corner, mostly messed up in corners

3. 2/21 - split screen happening at wrong location
    - had wrong # of bits in the line compare register
4. 2/24 - making image buffer of from string wasn't working at all 
    - to get the individual pixel value i was using (lol & b) to set the color
    but I needed to be using (lol& (1 << b)), a stupid logic error
